# Empty file to prevent Android Build System from finding Android.mk files in
# subdirectories. Those files are not needed and, moreover, some even clash with
# the real ones to be used (for example,
# "./mediatek/platform/mt6589/hardware/camera/device/Android.mk" clashes with
# "<root>/hardware/libhardware/modules/camera/Android.mk").
